title: How I Launched my Brand New Site in 24 Hours
---

This past week, I found myself staring at my sorry excuse for a website and knew it was time for a change. I was previously ‘borrowing’ space on a server from a good friend of mine at [Rentabilities ][1] and I felt it was time to claim my own digital 40 acres, so to speak. So I set out on the arduous task that is setting up a new site.

## Step 1: Picking a CMS

There are tons of great CMS options out there, but I was able to quickly narrow it down to three options (thanks to recommendations from friends) : [Harmony][2], [Octopress][3], and [WordPress][4].

### HARMONY

My good friend [Dan Ritz][5] recommended Harmony as an avid user himself. His [site][6] looks pretty sweet so I decided to look into it. Harmony’s claim to fame is that it’s a hosted CMS so there’s no set up or server tinkering required. Definitely a plus for a Unix newb such as myself. The back end interface looked well crafted and the templating seemed fairly flexible. The only knock against Harmony is that it’s $30 a month. Not crazy, but I thought I could do better with a separate hosting service with an open source CMS.

### Octopress

I’m not 100% sure when I first heard of Octopress, but I had an inkling that I should check it out. My first impression of Octopress was that their site (which is presumably built on Octopress) looked kind or janky. Ok, no big deal, maybe the creator is a hardcore developer, we can’t all be perfect. Anyway, The neat thing about Octopress is that it’s built to work with the [Jekyll][7] site generator. If you’re not familiar with Jekyll, you hook it up to a GitHub repo and have it look at a directory containing [markdown][8] files. Jekyll will take those markdown files and spit out the full html for your site. Pretty freaking cool if you ask me.

### WordPress

Good ol’ WordPress. I can honestly say that the reason I am a Designer today is because of WordPress. I learned HTML/CSS messing with WordPress themes and PHP was the first web language I ever used. WordPress boasts an awesome community of theme and plugin developers, as well as outstanding documentation. When I spun up a local server to check out the latest version, I noticed the new default theme (TwentyEleven) was simple and responsive. I didn’t want to design my own theme from scratch, so this seemed like a solid base to build on (or in my case subtract from).

In the end, I ended up going with WordPress. My desire to challenge myself to set up and configure my own server, the solid default template, and my nostalgia were the main factors in my decision.

## Step 2: Set Up the Server

The words ‘Unix Shell’ have historically sent shivers down my spine. However, during my time at [HubSpot][9] I’ve worked a lot with terminal and felt it was time to take my skills to the next level. I chose [Linode][10] as my hosting provider based on a recommendation from a friend (Are you seeing the pattern here?). Linode is a virtual hosting provider so every customer has a virtual slice of a server to do whatever they like with. I was attracted to the  great deal flexibility they allow as well as the highly touted customer support.

### Linode

Getting setup with Linode was a breeze thanks to their awesome [set up documentation][11]. I can’t claim to understand *every* command they instructed me to type into the shell, but I had a fairly good idea what was going on.

The first problem I ran into occurred when I attemped to set up permalinks and caching with[ WP Super Cache][12]. Whenever I turned on permalinks, in order to cache my pages, each article link directed me to a 404 page. After hours of fruitless Google searching, I was able to determine that mod_rewrite, which rewrites the permalink urls, was disabled by default on Linode. Lesson learned.

## So Fresh and so Clean, Clean

All in all, after about 24 hours of server tinkering and theme hacking, I was able to set up and launch a brand new website with WordPress and Linode. I’m thrilled with the results and can’t wait to continue to share on this blog.

I was ordering food with [GrubHub][2] on my iPhone this past week and was pleasantly surprised by this simple graphic on the confirmation screen:

<img class="block-image" src="/images/grubhub.png" alt="grubhubbers dancing">

What you aren't able to see is when you tap the image, the cartoons begin to dance. This type of interaction is what [Chuck Longanecker][3] calls an [emotionally intelligent interaction][4].

> An emotionally intelligent interaction is any state (or change in state) of a website/app where the messaging or functionality includes attention to details that create a user experience that feels organic and human. These interactions can be a big experience (like when an entire website is down), or a very small experience (such as when an error state on a form element appears). They can be derived from different elements, including messaging and copy, color and design, and responsiveness to user inputs and system outputs.
> 
> Combining each of these crafted experiences creates soul and personality for a website. And it's that **emotional connection with users** that builds lasting loyalty, and raving fans.

GrubHub has done a great job building a brand with a charming personality that breeds loyal customers.  As designers it's easy to forget that we have so many opportunities like this to put a smile on our user's faces. Try adding an emotionally intelligent interaction to your app, I'm sure your users will appreciate it.

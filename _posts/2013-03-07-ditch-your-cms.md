title: Ditch Your CMS
---

Recently, I have been looking at a ton of personal websites as part of our design recruiting efforts at my current job. It's shocking to me how many people who make their living on the web are still using a big clunky CMS platforms like Wordpress. 

Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, and countless other CMS platforms are the most popular way to publish content to the web; and all of them suck.  There are millions of slow bloated CMS generated websites out there, and yours doesn't have to be one of them.

## Your CMS is slow
A CMS is bloated and full of crap you probably don't need. Having these big bloated sites is slow. Requiring database queries slows down browsing even more. It also requires much more bandwidth. You need to implement a complicated caching system to get around it. With a static html site your pages are automatically cached for you. My old Wordpress install was **50mb** and there were only 3 articles. My new Jekyll site, with the exact same content is a grand total of **384kb** and loads in **421ms**. I couldn't find a personal Wordpress site that loaded in under 3 seconds.

## Your CMS is not personal
As a web professional your website should be a reflection of yourself. So why would you want code someone else wrote on there? Every line of code should be intentional and have a purpose. Every layout decision should be based on what you believe to be beautiful as a result of your own experiences. The way you craft your code, and what you deem important is a reflection of yourself. Default pages that get generated automatically often serve no purpose (i.e. a Wordpress category page with only one post).

## Your CMS is easily replaceable	
Templates mean you don't have to repeat code. Blog post list will automatically update when you make a post. Both things can be accomplished with Jekyll.

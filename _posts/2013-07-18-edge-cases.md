Designing simple products is hard. Software that starts simple has the tendency to become more and more complicated as time goes on. Ideas come pouring in from customers and stake holders for that next 'must have' feature. In many cases, those features are edge cases that will only be useful to a small subset of your customers. Trying to optimize your interface to serve all of these edge cases, as well as your primary use cases, can quickly lead to complexity. In order to design simple products, you must be able to identify these edge case features, and de-prioritize them.

Some may argue that the ideal situation is to stick to ideals and keep your product in its simplest form, never adding any of these edge cases. This approach may satisfy design purists following some sacred set of ideals, but it is often unrealistic when you're trying to grow your customer base. At HubSpot we've found that adding this type of functionality is ok, as long as it stays out of the way of the main use cases.

It's ok if your interface doesn't allow for an advanced task to be completed quickly and easily. Beginners will benefit from not being intimidated by a myriad of features they don't understand. Advanced users are often willing to click a few extra times for advanced functionality. The benefit they receive from that advanced functionality is often worth the extra effort.

One of the best examples of this principle in action is Google Search. There's a ton of advanced search functionality that has been added over the years, but the home page remains just a single input box. In order to access those advanced search features, you either need to know advanced query syntax, or find the advanced search link buried in a drop down menu on the results page. Google recognizes that a majority of their users don't need that advanced functionality, and keeps it out of the way.

It sounds easy, but it practice it's much harder than seems. Our design instincts tell us to optimize for the fewest number of clicks and screens. We are always trying to create a delightfully simple experience for all our users. We must ignore those instincts when dealing with edge cases in order to keep our interfaces simple.

## Background
Here at HubSpot, our mission is not only to build marketing software, but also to help businesses transform the way they do marketing. When we onboard a new customer, it's difficult to not only teach them how to use a powerful new software platform, but to adopt a new marketing playbook. One of the ways we help our new customers be successful is by offering free training classes which teach them how to use the software as well as the methodology.

## The Current Training App
When we built the first iteration of the Training App, our goal was to build something as simple as possible. At the time, we only had 5 classes and we wanted to be sure that customers would find it useful. We built out a simple class list page where you could mark off each class you completed to track your progress.

After the initial launch, the customer feedback was positive. Usage continued to grow and new classes were added every month. The number of classes ballooned up to over 20 and our original design wasn't scaling. Our usage stats said that 75% of our customers were using the training up at least once a month, so we felt like it was worth investing more time into.

## Step 1: Scoping the Project

Brian McMullin, the Product Manager on the project, Mark Kilens, the Leader of the HubSpot Training Team, and myself sat down to discuss the future of the Training App. Instead of organizing the growing number of classes in a single list, we decided to break out related classes into separate training courses. That way, our customers would be able to progress through training in smaller, easily digestible bites. We wanted our customers to feel like they were making progress as well as mastering the skills that they were learning. This would require us to design and build a page which lists all the courses and the progress in each course. We would also need a detail page for each course listing the classes contained in it as well as a description for each class.

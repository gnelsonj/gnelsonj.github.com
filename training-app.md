## Background
Here at HubSpot, our mission is not only to create software that people love, but also to help businesses transform the way they do marketing. We like to call it the Inbound Marketing Methodology. When we bring on a new customer, it's often a daunting task to not only learn a powerful new software platform, but to adopt a new marketing playbook. One of the ways we help our customers be successful right out of the gate is with free training classes that help you learn the tools as well as the methodology.

## The Current Training App
When we built the first iteration of the Training App, our goal was to build something as simple as possible. At the time, we only had 5 classes and we wanted to be sure that customers would find it useful.

After the initial launch, the customer feedback was positive. Usage continued to grow and new classes were added every month. The number of classes ballooned up to over 20 and our original design wasn't scaling. Our usage stats said that 75% of our customers were using the training up at least once a month, so we felt like it was worth investing more time into.

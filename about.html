    <ol class="span4">
        <li><strong>Understand the problem:</strong> Interview users or review user research to develop an understanding of the user's goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand the current solutions:</strong> Examine how users are currently solving their problems. Are they currently using a different app to solve this problem? An excel spreadsheet? A pen and paper?</li>
        <li><strong>Ideation and sketching:</strong> diverge and explore possible solutions to the problem in the form of sketching. Keep the sketches simple to iterate through ideas quickly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Review the sketches and pick the best ideas, or combination of the best ideas, and present them in a high enough fidelity to properly convey how the interface will function.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Present the prototype to as many users as possible. Gather feedback. Iterate based on that feedback.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Find and engineer and build the damn thing.</li>

<h3>My Process</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Understand the problem:</strong> Include as many users, or people who truly understand the user as possible and flesh out the user's goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Understand the current solutions:</strong> Are users currently using a different app to solve this problem? Are they using an excel spreadsheet? Are they using a pen and paper?</li>
    <li><strong>Ideation and sketching:</strong> Diverge and explore as many different solutions to the problem as possible.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Pick the best ideas, or a combination of the best ideas, and present them in a fidelity high enough to understand how the interface will work.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Show the prototype to as many users, or people who truly understand the users as possible. Gather feedback. Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Build the damn thing.</li></ol>

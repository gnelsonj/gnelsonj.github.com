<ol>
    <li><strong>Understand the problem:</strong> Interview users or review user research to develop an understanding of the user's goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Understand the current solutions:</strong> Examine how users are currently solving their problems. Are they currently using a different app to solve this problem? An excel spreadsheet? A pen and paper?</li>
    <li><strong>Ideation and sketching:</strong> Diverge and explore possible solutions to the problem in the form of sketching. Keep the sketches simple to interate through ideas quickly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Review the sketches and pick the best ideas, or combination of the best ideas, and present them in a high enough fidelity to properly convey how the interface will function.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Present the prototype to as many users as possible. Gather feedback. Iterate based on that feedback.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Find and engineer and build the damn thing.</li></ol>
